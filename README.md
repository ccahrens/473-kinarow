# 473-kinarow
Hello and welcome! This is a small project created by [CC Ahrens](https://github.com/ccahrens) and [Cin Ahrens](https://github.com/cinahrens) for CSE 473: Intro to AI
at the University of Washington. Some of the files were created partially or entirely
by course staff during autumn quarter of 2024. The course was taught by Professor
Steve Tanimoto.

## Skills demonstrated
This project is intended to demonstrate our understanding of algorithms such as MiniMax, as well
as Zobrist Hashing, a hash function used to play abstract board games. Additionally, we demonstrated
our ability to call external AI APIs to create dialogue that responds to opponents in character.

## The characters
The characters that we created were intended to be funny and light weight. For more about the characters,
please visit the [ProjectReport](https://github.com/ccahrens/473-kinarow/tree/main/ProjectReport) directory.
